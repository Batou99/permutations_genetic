# permutations-genetic

This is the same example as: [this](https://github.com/jleahred/katas/tree/master/langs/haskell/machine_revisions_problem)

This uses a genetic algorithm approach instead of a permutations based one.
It will probably be more performant for a large number of machines.

NOTE: The algorithm is rather naive and can be stuck at local minima.
